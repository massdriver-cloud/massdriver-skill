# Quick Bundle Generation

Generate a Massdriver bundle scaffold based on a use case description. This is the non-interactive "quick gen" mode - it creates the bundle files and hands off to you for testing.

## What This Does

1. Ask a few quick questions about the bundle
2. Generate the complete bundle structure
3. Run local validation (`mass bundle build`, `tofu validate`)
4. Hand off to you for deployment and testing

## Usage

```
/massdriver:gen RDS MySQL database for OLTP workloads

/massdriver:gen Lambda function with API Gateway trigger

/massdriver:gen S3 bucket for data lake landing zone
```

## Instructions

### 1. Quick Requirements

Ask the user (if not clear from the description):
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
- What connections does it need (network, credentials)?
- What artifact does it produce?
- Any specific presets they want?

### 2. Generate Bundle Structure

Create the bundle in `bundles/<bundle-name>/`:

```
bundles/<bundle-name>/
├── massdriver.yaml     # Bundle manifest with params, connections, artifacts
├── README.md           # Bundle documentation
├── operator.md         # Runbook template
└── src/
    ├── main.tf         # Primary Terraform code
    ├── artifacts.tf    # massdriver_artifact resources
    └── .checkov.yml    # Checkov skip rules (if any)
```

### 3. Apply Best Practices

- **Params**: Focus on 3-5 developer-facing questions, use presets
- **80/20 rule**: Cover common use cases, don't over-generalize
- **Connections**: Use existing resource types (`mass resource-type list`, ignore any `massdriver/` prefixed results)
- **Artifacts**: Match the resource type's schema exactly (the YAML key is still `artifacts:`; runtime calls them resources)
- **Provider**: `mass resource-type get <platform>` FIRST, then write provider using only those fields — resource types and providers are 1:1
- **Compliance**: Default to secure settings, add `halt_on_failure` for prod

### 4. Local Validation

Run validation:
```bash
cd bundles/<bundle-name>
mass bundle build
mass bundle lint
cd src && tofu init && tofu validate
```

Fix any issues before finishing.

### 5. Hand Off

Tell the user:
- Where the bundle was created
- How to publish it: `mass bundle publish --development`
- For new resource types, publish them first: `mass resource-type publish artifact-definitions/<name>/massdriver.yaml` (no `--development` flag, goes live immediately)
- To deploy in v2: add the bundle as a component once at the project level (`mass component add <project> <bundle> --id <comp-id>`), then per environment set `mass instance version <project>-<env>-<comp>@latest --release-channel development` and `mass instance deploy <slug> --params=... --message "..." --follow`
- Suggest using `/massdriver:develop` if they want the full test loop
